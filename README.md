Create a single GitHub repository for all three levels, you can separate them into folders. For example: level-1, level-2 and level-3.
In the first two sprints you will need to upload the code to GitHub so that your mentor can see it. From sprint 3 you will have to deliver it by pull request, the way in which programmers deliver their work in companies.
If you are not sure how to upload your project to git, at the end of this statement there is an "Appendix I: Upload your code to git" which contains the steps you need to follow.
